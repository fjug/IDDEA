IDDEA gives more sophisticated selection algorithms along with user specific dimensions.\r\n\r\n2. Based on ImgLib2, developers can access the internal data bounded by ROIs.\r\n\r\n3. It should provide a simple way of creating new measuring/analysis/managing selection regions.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
