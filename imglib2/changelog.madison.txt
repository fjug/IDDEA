Stephan Saalfeld, Tobias Pietzsch, Stephan Preibisch:

* redesigned ImgLib core gaining the following improvements:
  * separation of access to the domain and codomain (position vs. type-access)
  * separation of iteration and random access
  * separation of real and integer coordinate access
  * virtualization of how data sets can be accessed, thus allowing generative
    functions, views on virtually transformed data, unevenly sampled data, and
    much more
  * improved performance
  * simplified generalized display

* added interactive panorama viewer as  aplugin to Fiji (thanks Albert for
  doing the infrastructure)

* added integral images as a library component to the mpicbg submodule of Fiji
  with the following examplary applications:
  * rapid mean filter
  * rapid averaging downscaling
  * rapid difference of mean filter
