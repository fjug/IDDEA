/**
 * This {@link Img} stores an image in multiple linear arrays of basic types.
 * Much larger images can be represented than with {@link ArrayImg}. The number
 * of basic types that can be stored is {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}<sup>2</sup>.
 * However, access is less efficient than for {@link ArrayImg}.
 *
 * The image is divided into cells, that is, equally sized hyper-cubes (only
 * cells at the max boundary of the image may have non-standard sizes). Each
 * basic type array corresponds to a cell.
